## Introduction

The prevalence of mobile devices in daily tasks has led to the demand for efficient communication apps. 
This project aims to address this demand by building a native chat app using React Native, Expo, and Google Firestore Database. 
The app serves as a showcase of JavaScript mobile development skills and offers a platform for users to engage in seamless conversations, share images, and exchange location data.
